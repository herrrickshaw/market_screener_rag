# Market playbook — retail-accessible edges, ranked by priority per market

Only durable + retail-harvestable edges (low information-asymmetry tax). Ranked by this project's backtests. 🥇 primary · 🥈 secondary · ⚙️ base · 🚫 avoid (tested & fails).

## IN — *momentum / long-only*

- 🥇 PRIMARY — **Momentum / Trend** — trend DSR 0.994 — most robust factor found; long-only
- 🥈 secondary — **Value-reversion (cheap PE)** — +5.3%/6M t2.5 (sector-relative), long-only
- 🥈 secondary — **Quality (hi-ROE) overlay** — earns premium behind the liquidity gate
- ⚙️ base — **Insider sentiment (6-12m)** — filings-based, 6-12m outperformance
- ⚙️ base — **Passive core (DCA+rebalance)** — always-on base: DCA + annual rebalance, vol-targeted
- 🚫 AVOID — **Value+Quality Long/Short** — −1.0%/6M — momentum runs shorts over

## US — *mixed / efficient — light*

- 🥇 PRIMARY — **Value-reversion (cheap PE)** — +1.7%/3M t2.3 — best US edge, hold ≤3M
- ⚙️ base — **Value+Quality Long/Short** — +1.7%/6M t1.0 marginal
- ⚙️ base — **Momentum / Trend** — mom DSR 0.90 fragile — light
- ⚙️ base — **Insider sentiment (6-12m)** — SEC Form 4, documented edge
- ⚙️ base — **Passive core (DCA+rebalance)** — always-on base: DCA + annual rebalance, vol-targeted
- 🚫 AVOID — **Quality (hi-ROE) overlay** — Piotroski INVERTED in US

## KR — *mean-reversion / full L/S*

- 🥇 PRIMARY — **Value+Quality Long/Short** — +4.83%/6M t4.17 — STRONGEST edge of all; full L/S
- 🥈 secondary — **Value-reversion (cheap PE)** — +3.85%/6M t1.5
- 🥈 secondary — **Momentum / Trend** — breakout DSR 0.99
- 🥈 secondary — **Quality (hi-ROE) overlay** — hi-ROE cheap = the Korea discount
- ⚙️ base — **Insider sentiment (6-12m)** — DART disclosures
- ⚙️ base — **Passive core (DCA+rebalance)** — always-on base: DCA + annual rebalance, vol-targeted

## JP — *value-reversion*

- 🥇 PRIMARY — **Value-reversion (cheap PE)** — +6.6%/6M t4.84 — strongest value anywhere
- 🥈 secondary — **Value+Quality Long/Short** — ROE available; extension of value
- ⚙️ base — **Quality (hi-ROE) overlay** — pairs with value
- ⚙️ base — **Insider sentiment (6-12m)** — EDINET disclosures
- ⚙️ base — **Passive core (DCA+rebalance)** — always-on base: DCA + annual rebalance, vol-targeted
- 🚫 AVOID — **Momentum / Trend** — no DSR survivor — whipsaws

## EU — *momentum (bull)*

- 🥇 PRIMARY — **Momentum / Trend** — mom252 DSR 0.985 — primary EU edge
- ⚙️ base — **Insider sentiment (6-12m)** — 
- ⚙️ base — **Passive core (DCA+rebalance)** — always-on base: DCA + annual rebalance, vol-targeted

## CN — *speculation-ruled — passive only*

- ⚙️ base — **Momentum / Trend** — untested but character-implied; use with care
- ⚙️ base — **Passive core (DCA+rebalance)** — always-on base: DCA + annual rebalance, vol-targeted
- 🚫 AVOID — **Value-reversion (cheap PE)** — TESTED & FAILS (t0.3) — do not run
- 🚫 AVOID — **Value+Quality Long/Short** — value leg fails

## Rules that apply everywhere

- **Horizon:** monthly-to-6-month rebalances only. Fast signals lose to the information-asymmetry tax (you'd be the counterparty).
- **Sizing:** inverse-vol + vol-target + a kill-switch (halves max drawdown).
- **Capacity:** the edge is illiquidity-driven — **~$300–500k** before it decays; a retail/family-office edge, not institutional.
- **Read spreads, not win-rate:** ~50% hit-rate is normal; the profit is in magnitude.
- **Long-only vs long/short:** short only where the market mean-reverts (KR ✅); never short a trending market (IN 🚫).
- **Costs:** net of round-trip cost the edge must still clear — worst in IN/CN (wide spreads), best in US.
