# Project retrospective — findings, gaps, and what to publish

A full-arc review from the platform's origin to the live paper-track: what we've established, what's still open, and which insights are novel enough to publish.

## The analysis arc (phases)

1. **Build** — multi-market platform, income/balance statements from the paper-track, 10-stage pipeline, regime survival, Lasso/learning-rate, AWS/Colab sweep, mailer/watchlist.
2. **Validate** — PIT reversion backtests, Deflated Sharpe, value+quality L/S, the suitability matrix; the market-character meta-finding.
3. **Guard** — the anti-false-outcome layer: data_sufficiency, data_ledger, source_registry, the every-3-days check; caught false JP/EU/CN verdicts.
4. **Collect** — deep PIT fundamentals (CN baostock 10y, JP EDINET/J-Quants, EU union, JPX sectors, Damodaran) with anti-throttle (baostock, curl_cffi); the Japan flip.
5. **Explain** — fundamentals-vs-speculation (3 lenses + Damodaran + ROIC/WACC + country-ERP), PEAD routing, the confusion-matrix/information-asymmetry synthesis.
6. **Evaluate** — 70 strategies (durability × access), screener.in popular screens, an audit of the prior working paper.
7. **Operationalise** — the market playbook → live playbook screener → watchlist → daily mailer (sent). Research is now a running system.

## Consolidated findings

| finding | confidence | status |
|---|--:|---|
| Market character decides the playbook (IN mom, KR L/S, JP/US value, EU mom, CN passive) | 9/10 | validated |
| Value-reversion works IN/US/KR/JP (t2.3–4.84), FAILS in China (t0.3, powered null) | 9/10 | validated |
| Momentum/trend survives multiple-testing in IN/KR/EU (Deflated Sharpe >0.95) | 8/10 | validated |
| Fundamentals-vs-speculation is the master dial (explains China null + biotech + PEAD routing) | 8/10 | validated |
| Three regimes not two: current-fundamentals / R&D-growth / speculation (R&D-adj ROIC) | 7/10 | validated |
| PEAD lives in the SPECULATIVE corner (information uncertainty), opposite of value-reversion | 7/10 | validated |
| Edge is MAGNITUDE not hit-rate (~50% accuracy yet profitable); illiquidity-driven, ~$300–500k cap | 8/10 | validated |
| Information-asymmetry tax is horizon-dependent → retail can only harvest SLOW edges | 8/10 | validated |
| Measurement > data quantity (Japan flip: null→+6.6%/6M t4.84 via EDINET depth) | 9/10 | validated |
| Country-ERP: China's cheapness is NOT risk-justified (CRP 0.91%) → speculation confirmed | 7/10 | validated |
| China value-reversion fails but momentum likely dominates | 3/10 | tentative/untested |
| EU value effect | 2/10 | underpowered — cannot conclude |

## Gaps to fix (prioritised by impact ÷ effort)

| gap | impact | effort | fix |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| valuation_clusters only IN/US/KR — JP/EU/CN have no peer clusters (screener falls back) | 8 | 3 | re-run valuation_clustering.py on JP_full/CN_full/EU_union (data now exists) → fills JP/EU picks |
| EV/EBITDA sector map not run (dam_vebitda downloaded) | 5 | 2 | capital-structure-neutral re-do of the sector map — de-distorts financials/asset-heavy |
| CN momentum untested (we assert 'likely' but never backtested) | 6 | 3 | run deflated_sharpe/regime on CN warehouse prices → confirm or kill the momentum claim |
| Short-borrow cost not modelled in KR/JP long/short returns | 6 | 3 | haircut the short leg by a locate+borrow estimate — the L/S t-stats are gross |
| Full-universe fundamentals-vs-speculation incomplete (US-only preview) | 6 | 4 | join Damodaran sector map (48k, instant) to all markets → the cross-market speculation map |
| Confusion matrix on SHORT-horizon signals (PEAD/momentum) not done | 6 | 4 | where the info-asymmetry tax actually bites — run the net-of-cost classifier on fast signals |
| H2 Accumulation (prior paper) never re-tested this session | 5 | 4 | OBV/Chaikin accumulation backtest — auditable open item from the paper |
| Regime (bull/bear) not wired into the LIVE screener (static filters) | 5 | 4 | condition the playbook screener on the breadth-regime proxy already built |
| Time-series speculation only US 2017–2025, shallow | 5 | 5 | deeper history + other markets once sector collection completes |
| Live forward performance = zero (paper-track just started) | 7 | 9 | TIME — the picks were only just watchlisted; needs weeks/months to validate out-of-sample |
| EU depth pre-2021 paywalled → EU value stays underpowered | 4 | 7 | national registries / paid vendor — low priority, hard |

### The quick, high-impact fixes (do next)

1. **Extend valuation clustering to JP/EU/CN** — the data now exists; instantly fills the thin JP/EU picks and gives peer-relative value everywhere (impact 8, effort 3).
2. **Backtest CN momentum** — resolve the one asserted-but-untested claim (impact 6, effort 3).
3. **Haircut the KR/JP L/S returns for borrow cost** — the strongest edge (KR t4.2) is gross of the short-leg cost; net it before trusting the magnitude (impact 6, effort 3).
4. **Join the Damodaran 48k sector map to all markets** — completes the cross-market speculation map without waiting on the yfinance crawl (impact 6, effort 3).

## What to publish

| insight | novelty | vehicle |
|---|--:|---|
| Measurement over quantity: the Japan value flip (null→edge via deep PIT data) | 9/10 | note/blog + v3 paper |
| Fundamentals-vs-speculation as a master dial (sector+market, PEAD routing) | 8/10 | working paper section |
| Cross-market factor character map (which factor fits which market, 6 markets deep-data) | 8/10 | v3 of the platform paper |
| Information-asymmetry tax × horizon: why retail can only harvest slow edges | 7/10 | blog/note |
| Three regimes: separating R&D-growth from speculation (R&D-adjusted ROIC) | 6/10 | note |

**The headline publishable contribution:** *measurement quality dominates data quantity* — demonstrated live by the Japan flip (an underpowered null became a t 4.84 edge when deep PIT history replaced a snapshot) **and** its mirror, China (a null that *survived* the same deepening). This is the inverse of the replication crisis and extends the prior working paper to a v3 with genuine cross-market deep data. The fundamentals-vs-speculation dial and the retail-harvestability framing are the two other sections worth writing up.
